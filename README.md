The trend was similar for the theater category campaigns as well.

- Comparison of successful and failed campaigns in US, we could deduce that failed campaigns tend to have higher goals than the successful ones. Also, we could tell from the distribution of goals that the median goal amount is rather closer to the lower quartile of the interquartile range. 

**Advise for Louise**
Theater is a pretty popular category among the Kickstarter campaigns.
